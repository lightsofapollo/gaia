We are spending a ton of time in reflows & css queries

- only escape HTML if char exists... (maybe only use one span for all escapes).

- in fixed_header.js#refresh we spend a ton of time here in selector
  lookups. (We spent almost 1.3S in this method alone)

- don't block loading contacts on async storage... (300-500ms)

- in find limit the total number per filter request (lets say to 200?)
